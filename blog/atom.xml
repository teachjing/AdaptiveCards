    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>We are excited to announce the release of Adaptive Cards 1.5!</p><p>This release contains some highly requested asks from our community as well as improvements to accessibility. One of our most requested features has been support for a Table element and we are happy to support this in Adaptive Cards 1.5!</p><h2 id="New-features"><a href="#New-features" class="headerlink" title="New features"></a>New features</h2><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/blob/main/specs/features/RTL.md">RTL</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4673">Input.Text Masking</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4715">ActionSet Overflow</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4668">Tooltip for Actions</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/blob/main/specs/features/Tables.md">Tables</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4713">Static Filtered ChoiceSet</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4670">Action.isEnabled</a></li></ol><h2 id="A-closer-look"><a href="#A-closer-look" class="headerlink" title="A closer look"></a>A closer look</h2><h3 id="RTL-Support"><a href="#RTL-Support" class="headerlink" title="RTL Support"></a>RTL Support</h3><p>Right to left support will enable users from around the globe. Begining in 1.5, users will now be able to set this optional <code>rtl</code> boolean at the <code>Adaptive Card</code>, <code>Container</code>, and <code>Column</code> level.</p><p><img src="/blog/2021/Announcing-1.5/rtl-sample.png" alt="rtl-sample"></p><h3 id="Input-Text-Masking"><a href="#Input-Text-Masking" class="headerlink" title="Input.Text Masking"></a>Input.Text Masking</h3><p>By setting <code>style</code> to <code>password</code> in <code>Input.Text</code>, card authors will now have the ability to mask text such as passwords.</p><p><img src="/blog/2021/Announcing-1.5/masking-sample.png" alt="masking-sample"></p><h3 id="ActionSet-Overflow"><a href="#ActionSet-Overflow" class="headerlink" title="ActionSet Overflow"></a>ActionSet Overflow</h3><p>The ActionSet Overflow flyout menu will allow card authors to provide additional actions on their card when limited space is available. This feature introduces the optional <code>mode</code> property to all action types. If this <code>mode</code> property is set to <code>secondary</code> for a given action, then a <code>...</code> overflow menu will render next to the actions that are set to <code>primary</code>.</p><p><img src="/blog/2021/Announcing-1.5/overflow-sample.gif" alt="overflow-sample"></p><h3 id="Tooltip-for-Actions"><a href="#Tooltip-for-Actions" class="headerlink" title="Tooltip for Actions"></a>Tooltip for Actions</h3><p>This feature will now allow card authors to specify text that should be displayed to the end user when they hover over an action. Narration software will also pick up on the text further improving our accessibility story. Text can be set using the <code>tooltip</code> property for actions.</p><p><img src="/blog/2021/Announcing-1.5/tooltip-sample.png" alt="tooltip-sample"></p><h3 id="🆕Table-Element🆕"><a href="#🆕Table-Element🆕" class="headerlink" title="🆕Table Element🆕"></a>🆕Table Element🆕</h3><p>The table element has been a highly requested feature and is now available in 1.5. This means that card authors will no longer need to nest <code>ColumnSets</code> to mimic table-like behavior and this new approach for tabular data is much more accessible. This new table element will have a concept of columns and rows working as you would expect it to. Note: advanced functionality like sorting and dynamic sizing is not supported in this initial release.</p><p><img src="/blog/2021/Announcing-1.5/table-sample.gif" alt="table-sample"></p><h3 id="Static-Filtered-ChoiceSet"><a href="#Static-Filtered-ChoiceSet" class="headerlink" title="Static Filtered ChoiceSet"></a>Static Filtered ChoiceSet</h3><p><code>Input.ChoiceSet</code> has been improved with the addition of a new <code>style</code> known as <code>filtered</code>. Setting the <code>style</code> to <code>filtered</code> will enable search and auto complete on the <code>Input.ChoiceSet</code> for a static list of choices.</p><p><img src="/blog/2021/Announcing-1.5/choiceset-sample.gif" alt="choiceset-sample"></p><h3 id="Action-isEnabled"><a href="#Action-isEnabled" class="headerlink" title="Action.isEnabled"></a>Action.isEnabled</h3><p>All actions will now have a boolean <code>isEnabled</code> property that is initially set to <code>true</code>. Setting this property to <code>false</code> will both visually and functionaly disable the element associated with the action.</p><p><img src="/blog/2021/Announcing-1.5/isEnabled-sample.png" alt="isEnabled-sample"></p><h2 id="When-can-I-use-it"><a href="#When-can-I-use-it" class="headerlink" title="When can I use it?"></a>When can I use it?</h2><p>These features are available today for you to test in our designer!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>In the Adaptive Cards community call for October, Matt Hidinger gave a demo and deep-dive into Adaptive Components.</p><h3 id="Deep-dive-into-Adaptive-Components"><a href="#Deep-dive-into-Adaptive-Components" class="headerlink" title="Deep dive into Adaptive Components"></a>Deep dive into Adaptive Components</h3><p><em>(Note: we’ve iterated on this quite a bit since last month’s community call)</em></p><p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4761">Adaptive Components</a> are a new concept that enable the creation of high-level UI “components” powered by <a href="https://aka.ms/ACTemplating">templating</a> and Adaptive Card elements. You can think of them like “molecules”, built by arranging Adaptive Card elements (“atoms”) into unique and helpful ways.</p><p>For example, the card below contains two Components:</p><ol><li>The “File Component”, showing the file icon, title, URL and set of actions to open the file.</li><li>The two “People Components”, next to <strong>Requested by</strong> and <strong>Approver</strong> showing the person’s profile picture and name.</li></ol><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1-2.png" alt="screenshot of a card with two components"></p><p>Components can be rendered within the card body by providing the <code>name</code> of the component you want to use, using the convention of <code>[COMPONENT-DOMAIN]/[COMPONENT-NAME]</code>. For example, if you want to use the File Chiclet component seen above, you’ll use the name <code>"graph.microsoft.com/file"</code> and provide the file <code>properties</code> received from the Graph API.</p><p>Notice only the data properties are needed to render the component, so for Files, you pass along the <strong>name</strong>, <strong>fileType, and webUrl</strong>.</p><pre><code class="json">{    "type": "AdaptiveCard",    "body": [        {            "type": "Component",            "name": "graph.microsoft.com/file",            "properties": {               "name": "FY2020-Contoso.docx",               "fileType": "docx",               "webUrl": "https://adaptivecardsblob.blob.core.windows.net/assets/AdaptiveCardsSpec.docx"            }        }    ]}</code></pre><p>When authoring a component for others to use, the creator gives the component a name, describes the shape of the data it expects, and uses <a href="https://aka.ms/ACTemplating">Templating and Expressions</a> to transform the data into Adaptive Card elements. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4761">GitHub issue</a> for some example components, or see the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/adaptivecards-templates/tree/components/components">backend component registry</a> for the full list.</p><p>The power of components is really in 3 areas:</p><ol><li><strong>Allow apps to learn new UI components on the fly.</strong> Because Components are purely declarative, we can rely on component registries to allow the fetching of remote components via HTTP.</li><li><strong>Help bootstrap the sharing of common types of UI</strong> among teams internally or with the public. Components can be hosted in GitHub repos and shared with others, making developers much more productive when building Cards.</li><li><strong>Support multiple views over data.</strong> Lastly, we plan to make a component broadly useful, on different Hosts, with different display constraints, and different renderer schema versions.

    <updated>2021-11-21T00:00:49.060Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>In the Adaptive Cards community call for September, Matt Hidinger shared the Q4 roadmap and a sneak peek at a new concept called “Adaptive Components.”</p><h3 id="Roadmap-Updates"><a href="#Roadmap-Updates" class="headerlink" title="Roadmap Updates"></a>Roadmap Updates</h3><p>We’ve divided the <a href="https://aka.ms/ACRoadmap">Roadmap Portal</a> to 3 distinct sections: <strong>Under Consideration</strong>, <strong>Planned</strong>, and <strong>Launched</strong>. This change provides more clarity into what stage any given feature currently is and when you can expect a given enhancement.</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Snippet-of-the-product-roadmap-portal-1024x401.png" alt="Snippet of the product roadmap portal"></p><p>Coming in Q4 and Q1 2021 you can expect the following things:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/sdk"><strong>Templating SDKs</strong></a> <strong>for iOS, Android, and UWP</strong>. Currently the templating SDKs are only available for .NET and JavaScript. This work will pave the way for exciting improvements once we are able to evaluate template bindings and expressions directly on the client where the cards are being rendered.</li><li><strong>A new Universal Action model for handling actions in your backend in a consistent way</strong>, whether the card appears in Teams, Outlook, or elsewhere. We’ll share more details on this shortly.</li><li><strong>In the Rendering/Schema category, we’ve got some nice fit-and-finish improvements under way:</strong><ul><li>Improved accessibility across the board.</li><li><a href="https://portal.productboard.com/adaptivecards/1-adaptive-cards-features/c/63-input-text-password-masking">Text password masking</a>.</li><li>ChoiceSet is getting a new <a href="https://portal.productboard.com/adaptivecards/1-adaptive-cards-features/c/64-input-choiceset-search-filtering-ux-static-list-of-choices">filtering UX</a>, <a href="https://portal.productboard.com/adaptivecards/1-adaptive-cards-features/c/15-input-choiceset-auto-complete">Auto Complete</a> support, and the ability to <a href="https://portal.productboard.com/adaptivecards/1-adaptive-cards-features/c/65-input-choiceset-changeaction">trigger an Action when a choice is made</a>.</li><li>For Actions we’re adding an <a href="https://portal.productboard.com/adaptivecards/1-adaptive-cards-features/c/67-action-isenabled-property">isEnabled property to disable actions</a> and creating enhanced UX for additional actions by allowing them <a href="https://portal.productboard.com/adaptivecards/1-adaptive-cards-features/c/58-actionset-overflow-into-a-flyout">overflow into a “…” menu</a>.</li></ul></li><li>And much more that we are still fleshing out the details on…</li></ul><p>As always, be sure to vote on the features that are important to you and click that <strong>Submit Idea</strong> button if you don’t already see it!</p><h3 id="Adaptive-Components"><a href="#Adaptive-Components" class="headerlink" title="Adaptive Components"></a>Adaptive Components</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4761">Adaptive Components</a> are a new concept that enable the creation of high-level UI “components” powered by <a href="https://aka.ms/ACTemplating">templating</a> and Adaptive Card elements.</p><p>For example, in the card below there are two great use-cases for “components”:</p><ol><li>The File Chiclet, showing the file icon, title, URL and set of actions.</li><li>The two “Personas” next to <strong>Requested by</strong> and <strong>Approver</strong> showing the profile picture and name.</li></ol><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/two-%E2%80%9CPersonas%E2%80%9D-next-to-Requested-by-and-Approver-showing-the-profile-picture-and-name..png" alt="screenshot of a card with a file and user component"></p><p>The way components are used within a Card is by a <strong>Component.<name></name></strong> convention. For example, see the <strong>Component.File</strong> usage below. Notice only the data is provided to the component, so for files, you pass along the <strong>title</strong>, <strong>fileType</strong>, and the <strong>objectUrl</strong>.</p><pre><code class="json">{    "type": "AdaptiveCard",    "body": [        {            "type": "Component.File",            "title": "FY2020-Contoso.docx",            "fileType": "docx",            "objectUrl": "https://example.com/assets/AdaptiveCardsSpec.docx"        }    ]}</code></pre><p>When authoring a component, the creator describes the shape of the data it expects using JSON-Schema and uses Templating and Expressions to transform the data into Adaptive Card elements. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4761">GitHub issue</a> for a detailed example of this.</p><p>The power of components is really in 3 areas:</p><ol><li><strong>Allow apps to learn new UI components on the fly.</strong> Because Components are purely declarative, we can rely on component registries to allow the fetching of remote components via HTTP.</li><li><strong>Help bootstrap the sharing of common types of UI</strong> among teams internally or with the public. Components can be hosted in GitHub repos and shared with others, making developers much more productive when building Cards.</li><li><strong>Support multiple views over data.</strong> Lastly, we plan to make a component broadly useful, on different Hosts, with different display constraints, and different renderer schema versions. The example below shows a simple “Thing” component that has 3 different views over the same data.</li></ol><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hero-thumbnail-and-stack-image-of-golden-gate-bridge-1024x361.png" alt="Hero, thumbnail and stack image of golden gate bridge"></p><p>Let us know on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/4761">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://adaptivecards.productboard.com/portal/1-adaptive-cards-features/tabs/c88173a2-a3a1-4bc5-ad15-11051b3c7942/features/5478079/portal/expanded">Productboard</a> if components is something you would benefit from in your day-to-day card usage!</p><h3 id="Watch-the-call-here"><a href="#Watch-the-call-here" class="headerlink" title="Watch the call here"></a>Watch the call here</h3><iframe width="560" height="315" title="Adaptive Cards Community Call Recording" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DkDfB5I8tJI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h3 id="Resources"><a href="#Resources" class="headerlink" title="Resources"></a>Resources</h3><ul><li><a href="https://aka.ms/m365sk134">Watch the latest Adaptive Cards session from Build 2020</a></li><li><a href="https://aka.ms/ACRoadmap">Adaptive Cards Roadmap</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/">Adaptive Card Templating Overview</a></li></ul><p>Next month’s call will be held on <strong>Thursday, October 8, 2020 at 9:00am PST.</strong> We look forward to talking to you then!

He kicked off a project called “<a href="https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Input.Text.html">Consistent Cards</a>“ that facilitates rapid end-to-end testing of any changes we make to the various renderers and instantly see how the various payloads look on live machines.</p><p>It works by sending a card payload through virtual machines that are hosting our Adaptive Card renderers on the various platforms, like NodeJS, .NET WPF, Android, and UWP. Below is a screenshot of a card that has been rendered live, on all 4 platforms, and returns their screenshots to the web app. This allows us to quickly see differences and troubleshoot visual bugs on the different UI stacks.</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-of-Consistent-Cards-showing-a-card-rendering-on-4-different-platforms-1024x464.png" alt="Screenshot of Consistent Cards showing a card rendering on 4 different platforms"></p><p>Currently, this tool is used internally for us during development, but we see the value of it being publicly available. We don’t have any plans to share on this front just yet but keep us posted if this is something you would be interested in!</p><p>To learn more, check out <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/blob/main/specs/DesignDiscussions/ConsistentCards.md">the project outline and spec</a> or just jump right into the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/tree/hammad-h/test-card-consistency/source/tools/testConsistency">source code</a>.</p><h3 id="Automating-real-world-scenarios-using-Power-Automate"><a href="#Automating-real-world-scenarios-using-Power-Automate" class="headerlink" title="Automating real-world scenarios using Power Automate"></a>Automating real-world scenarios using Power Automate</h3><p>Lastly, <a href="https://twitter.com/TomaszPoszytek?s=20"><strong>Tomasz Poszytek</strong></a>, a Power Platform MVP, walked through some amazing real-world business processes that can be streamlined and improved using Power Automate.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>Welcome to our Adaptive Cards community call series for 2020, the 2nd Thursday of each month. We are excited to provide you with a monthly opportunity to learn about Adaptive Cards in general, how they could be a great tool in your applications and contribute to the evolution of the format and SDKs. Each month, we’ll discuss new features we are bringing to the platform, our roadmap, and listen to your feedback and suggestions.</p><p>Agenda for this month’s call, hosted by Matt Hidinger, included:</p><h2 id="Build-2020-and-a-look-at-the-Roadmap"><a href="#Build-2020-and-a-look-at-the-Roadmap" class="headerlink" title="Build 2020 and a look at the Roadmap"></a>Build 2020 and a look at the Roadmap</h2><p>Build 2020 was all-virtual this year, and we had the opportunity to share the latest and greatest coming to Adaptive Cards on the <a href="https://aka.ms/m365sk134">YouTube session</a>. The session focused on four areas, outlined below.</p><h3 id="Adaptive-Card-Templating-and-Designer-Updates"><a href="#Adaptive-Card-Templating-and-Designer-Updates" class="headerlink" title="Adaptive Card Templating and Designer Updates"></a>Adaptive Card Templating and Designer Updates</h3><p>Templating helps you save time by easily populating reusable card templates with data. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/sdk">Release Candidate SDKs</a> are now available for .NET and JavaScript, and we plan to make them Generally Available in the coming weeks. We also added rich data-binding support in the <a href="https://adaptivecards.io/designer">Adaptive Card Designer</a> to make it even faster to design new cards based on your data payloads.</p><p><a href="https://aka.ms/ACTemplating">Get started with templating</a></p><h3 id="Adaptive-Cards-v2-Universal-Actions"><a href="#Adaptive-Cards-v2-Universal-Actions" class="headerlink" title="Adaptive Cards v2: Universal Actions"></a>Adaptive Cards v2: Universal Actions</h3><p>Next we officially unveiled Adaptive Cards v2, which adds a new “universal action model” to Adaptive Cards, making it possible to create actionable cards that can communicate with a backend server in a standard way, whether those cards are in Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Cortana Skills, or anywhere else.</p><p>Stay tuned to this space, as we’ll have plenty more to share on this topic throughout the year.</p><h3 id="Card-Author-Services"><a href="#Card-Author-Services" class="headerlink" title="Card Author Services"></a>Card Author Services</h3><p>Lastly, we discussed a recent additional to the Adaptive Cards family: the “<a href="https://adaptivecards.io/blog/2020/Community-Call-April/">Adaptive Cards CMS</a>“ or “Card Author Services”.</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1.png" alt="A screenshot of ACMS dashboard."></p><p>This product offers a centralized place to create, manage, share, and use card templates for your own apps or the entire organization. It includes a user-friendly card management portal, configurable storage and authentication, and a REST API for accessing your cards. We’re still working on the final name and release plan, but the good news is this project is still in development and we hope to have a preview that is available this summer. We also welcome community support and contributions if this is something that interests you.</p><h3 id="Putting-it-all-together"><a href="#Putting-it-all-together" class="headerlink" title="Putting it all together"></a>Putting it all together</h3><p>Here’s a look at each of our major investment areas and what to expect for the rest of 2020 and throughout 2021.</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-2.png" alt="Adaptive cards roadmap, visit https://aka.ms/ACRoadmap for details"></p><h2 id="SharePoint-web-part-for-Adaptive-Cards"><a href="#SharePoint-web-part-for-Adaptive-Cards" class="headerlink" title="SharePoint web part for Adaptive Cards"></a>SharePoint web part for Adaptive Cards</h2><p>Also, this month we were joined by Office Dev MVP Hugo Bernier, who showcased an impressive and user-friendly SharePoint web part for hosting Adaptive Cards –<wbr> with full templating support!

    <title>🎉 Templating Release Candidate now available</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>The goal of Adaptive Card Templating is to <strong>save you time</strong> when building cards.</p><p>This post will walk through the basic templating features as well as some advanced ones. Along the way, we will walk through you the updated template syntax, and introduce the <em>Adaptive Expression Language (AEL)</em>. </p><p>We will be working on an Expense report card. This expense report card is available in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/blob/main/samples/v1.2/Scenarios/ExpenseReport.json">our github repository</a>. We will turn this Adaptive Card into a template, so we can dynamically populate and generate an Adaptive Card based on dynamic data!</p><p><img src="/blog/2020/Templating-RC/ExpenseReport01.png" alt="Expense Report First Iteration"></p><h2 id="Breaking-change-in-May-2020"><a href="#Breaking-change-in-May-2020" class="headerlink" title="Breaking change in May 2020"></a>Breaking change in May 2020</h2><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you’ve been using the templating preview, we made a breaking change in the binding syntax. It went from <code>{...}</code> to <code>${...}</code>.</p><p> For example: <code>"text": "{name}"</code> becomes <code>"text": "${name}"</code></p><h2 id="Basic-Data-Binding"><a href="#Basic-Data-Binding" class="headerlink" title="Basic Data Binding"></a>Basic Data Binding</h2><p>The expense report’s JSON is over 800 lines. To update the contents of the card, we could manually port that code into an Adaptive Element object model using the various platform SDKs we make available (e.g., .NET or C++), but that would be quite the burden on a developer. Let’s take a look at how much easier it is using templating.</p><p>As an example, if we want to change the name of Submitter, <strong>Matt Hidinger</strong> to <strong>Jopseh Woo</strong>.<br>Given the json below, we will update it with a template and a “data binding expression”.</p><pre><code class="json">{    "type": "FactSet",    "spacing": "Large",    "facts": [        {            "title": "Submitted By",            "value": "**Matt Hidinger**  matt@contoso.com"        },        ...</code></pre><pre><code class="json">{    "type": "FactSet",    "spacing": "Large",    "facts": [        {            "title": "Submitted By",            "value": "**${submitter.name}**  ${submitter.e-mail}"        },        ...</code></pre><p>You’ll notice the card payload above is missing the data now. To make use of a template, we have to provide data that goes along with it. Data can be any valid JSON.</p><p>Here’s the data we will use for this example:</p><pre><code class="json">{    "submitter": {         "name" : "Joseph Woo",        "e-mail" : "hello@world.com"    }}</code></pre><p>And the updated card with the data:</p><p><img src="/blog/2020/Templating-RC/ExpenseReport02.png" alt="Expense Report First Iteration"></p><p>As long as the data’s format doesn’t change, this Adaptive Card template can be re-used. The final Adaptive Card payload will be “populated” according to the data the card is bound to. </p><h2 id="data-contexts"><a href="#data-contexts" class="headerlink" title="$data contexts"></a><code>$data</code> contexts</h2><p>The Expense Report Card has following layout, notice how each expense line item row has the same layout.</p><p><img src="/blog/2020/Templating-RC/ExpenseReport03.png" alt="Expense Report First Iteration"></p><p>Without a template, we have to manually build up the layout for each expense items. Since there are three expense items, we would have to create three <code>ColumnSets</code> each defining the same layout.</p><pre><code class="json">{    "type": "ColumnSet",    "columns": [        {            "type": "Column",            "items": [                {                    "type": "TextBlock",                    "text": "06/19",                    "wrap": true                }

]}</code></pre><p>Notice the new keyword: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/language#assigning-a-data-context-to-elements"><code>$data</code></a>. </p><p><code>$data</code> is used in this example to specify the “data context” for the <code>ColumnSet</code>, and in this example <code>expense</code> is a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_objects.asp">a JSON object</a>. Data contexts are useful when you have a deep object hierarchy and want to simplify the data-binding expressions for children of the element. For example, if <code>$data</code> context is defined on a <code>Container</code>, and if <code>TextBlock</code> is an item of the Container, the <code>TextBlock</code> will get the same data context. </p><p>Now let’s add an <code>expense</code> property to our data. </p><pre><code class="json">{    "submitter": {         "name" : "Joseph Woo",        "e-mail" : "hello@world.com"    },    "expense": {         "date" : "12/24/2020",        "amount" : 500,        "description" : "Air Travel Expense"     }}</code></pre><h2 id="Repeating-items-in-an-array"><a href="#Repeating-items-in-an-array" class="headerlink" title="Repeating items in an array"></a>Repeating items in an array</h2><p>With the addition of <code>expense</code>, binding will occur <em>almost</em> correctly. Another powerful feature of templating is <strong>repeating elements</strong>. As shown in the example, what was lacking was the ability to popluate the card with the submitter’s full set of line items.</p><p>This can be accomplished by a template’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/language#repeating-items-in-an-array">repeating element feature</a>. This allows adaptive elements to be repeated by simply changing the data type to array. </p><p><strong>If the data an element is bound to is an array, the Adaptive Card element will be repeated by the number of elements in the array.</strong></p><p>Let’s change the data to include the array of expense line items.</p><pre><code class="json">{    "submitter": {         "name" : "Joseph Woo",        "e-mail" : "hello@world.com"    },    "expenses": [         {             "date" : "12/24/2020",            "amount" : 500,            "description" : "Air Travel Expense"         },        {             "date" : "12/22/2020",            "amount" : 300,            "description" : "Auto Mobile Expense"         },        {             "date" : "12/21/2020",            "amount" : 400,            "description" : "Air Travel Expense"         },        {             "date" : "12/19/2020",            "amount" : 700,            "description" : "Air Travel Expense"         }    ]}</code></pre><p>Since the property is an array now, we’ve changed the name from <code>expense</code> to <code>expenses</code>. All you need to do now is change the <code>ColumnSet</code>‘s <code>$data</code> property to <code>expenses</code>.</p><p>Notice how the <code>ColumnSet</code> is repeating for 4 items now; once for each item in the array.</p><h2 id="Expressions-and-functions-using-Adaptive-Expressions"><a href="#Expressions-and-functions-using-Adaptive-Expressions" class="headerlink" title="Expressions and functions using Adaptive Expressions"></a>Expressions and functions using Adaptive Expressions</h2><p> We’re getting close, but there is one more problem. The type of <code>amount</code> is a number and not a string. This causes a problem in the binding by setting the <code>TextBlock</code>‘s <code>text</code> property to a non-string value, which will evluate to <code>"text": 500</code>. </p><p>Since this is no longer a valid Adaptive Card payload our renderer will drop the entire <code>TextBlock</code>. To convert a number to string, we can use the built-in <code>string</code> function. </p><p>Adaptive Card templating offers a rich set of functions and operators powered by the <a href="https://aka.ms/adaptive-expressions">Adpative Expression Language (AEL)</a>. </p><p>Changing <code>"text": "$${amount}"</code> to <code>"text": "$${string(amount)}"</code> resolves our final issue. Finally we don’t need non-templated ColumnSets for the expenses in the Expese Report card, so we can remove them. </p><p>If the template is run in the designer, it should look like this:</p><p><img src="/blog/2020/Templating-RC/ExpenseReport04.png" alt="Expense Report First Iteration"></p><h2 id="Advanced-repeating-items-with-index"><a href="#Advanced-repeating-items-with-index" class="headerlink" title="Advanced repeating items with $index"></a>Advanced repeating items with <code>$index</code></h2><p>The Expense Report card has a hidden element whose visibility can be toggled by interacting with a chevron arrow. To generate this element dynamically, we will create a <code>Container</code> that will include both the <code>ColumnSet</code> for the expense items and the <code>Action.ToggleVisibility</code> action. Then we can bind the data to the new Container which will get repeated for each item in the array.</p><pre><code class="json">{    "type" : "Container",    "$data": "${expenses}",    "items" : [               {     // expense item with cheveron mark            "type": "ColumnSet",            "columns": [                // ... skipped contents ...              ]        },        {     // hidden element with toggle visibility             "type": "Container",            "id": "cardContent0",            "isVisible": false,            "items": [                {                    ...                }            ]        }    ]}</code></pre><p><code>Action.ToggleVisibility</code> works by targeting an element’s ID. Using the ID, we can ask the AdaptiveElement with targeted ID to toggle its visibility.</p><pre><code class="json">"selectAction": {    "type": "Action.ToggleVisibility",    "title": "show history",    "targetElements": [        "cardContent0",        "chevronUp0",        "chevronDown0"    ]}</code></pre><p><code>targetElements</code> in the above example contains array of ids that the <code>selectionAction</code> is targetting.</p><p>If <code>"id": "cardContent0",</code>  is static text, toggle Visibility won’t work as designed. Since all of the repeated element’s ID would have same ID. </p><p>We can use the keyword <code>$index</code> for such cases. <code>$index</code> will evaluate to the index of the object within the array. For example, if <code>"id": "cardContent${$index}",</code> was part of 5th element in the array, <code>$index</code> will be evaluated to <code>"id": "cardContent4",</code> (since it’s 0-based)</p><pre><code class="json">{    "type" : "Container",    // expenses is json array, and will cause current Container including its sub elements to repeat for len(${expenses})    "$data": "${expenses}",    "items" : [               { // expense item with cheveron mark            "type": "ColumnSet",            "columns": [                // ...skipped content ...              ]        },        { // hidden element with toggle visibility             "type": "Container",            "id": "cardContent{$index}",            "isVisible": false,            "items": [                {                    ...                }            ]        }    ]}</code></pre><h2 id="More-built-in-functions"><a href="#More-built-in-functions" class="headerlink" title="More built-in functions"></a>More built-in functions</h2><p>Finally, the total amount of expense shown below is static, and should be fixed.</p><pre><code class="json">"items": [{    "type": "TextBlock",    "text": "404.30"}</code></pre><p>Using AEL’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/adaptive-expressions/adaptive-expressions-prebuilt-functions?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#sum">sum</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/adaptive-expressions/adaptive-expressions-prebuilt-functions?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#select">select</a> functions, we modify “403.30” to <code>${sum(select(expenses, x, x.amount))}</code>. This change will allow the card to dynamically update the expanses based on the data</p><pre><code class="json">"items": [{    "type": "TextBlock",    "text": "${string(sum(select(expenses, x, x.amount)))}"},</code></pre><p>After this changes, total sum correctly updated.</p><p><img src="/blog/2020/Templating-RC/ExpenseReport05.png" alt="Expense Report First Iteration"></p><p>Take a look at the <a href="https://adaptivecards.io/samples/ExpenseReport.html">full payload</a> for this sample. </p><p>We hope you found this tutorial and Adaptive Card templating useful, thanks for reading this far!</p></body></html>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>Welcome to our Adaptive Cards community call series, the 2nd Thursday of each month. We are excited to provide you with a monthly opportunity to learn about Adaptive Cards in general, how they could be a great tool in your applications and contribute to the evolution of the format and SDKs. Each month, we’ll discuss new features we are bringing to the platform, our roadmap, and listen to your feedback and suggestions.</p><p>Agenda for this month’s call, hosted by Matt Hidinger, included:</p><h3 id="Power-Automate-and-the-Template-Service"><a href="#Power-Automate-and-the-Template-Service" class="headerlink" title="Power Automate and the Template Service"></a>Power Automate and the Template Service</h3><p>The goal of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/">Adaptive Card Templating</a> is to <strong>save you time</strong> when building cards. And what’s better than building a card template yourself? <em>Having someone else build it!</em></p><p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/service">Adaptive Card Template Service</a> enables the community to contribute, discover, and share reusable templates over common data types, like the Microsoft Graph. If someone already wrote a template over the same data you have, why not use it! And while this service is already available in preview form, we wanted to go one step further: make it simple to use from Power Automate.</p><h3 id="What-the-heck-is-Power-Automate"><a href="#What-the-heck-is-Power-Automate" class="headerlink" title="What the heck is Power Automate?"></a>What the heck is Power Automate?</h3><p>Last month, Microsoft rebranded Flow into Power Automate. <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power Automate</a> is part of the Microsoft Power Platform which allows anyone (even non-developers) to optimize business workflows without having to write any code –<wbr> all from the convenience of their browser.</p><p>Below is a Flow I created for demo purposes during the community call. It’s a simple Flow that activates on the push of a button and presents an Adaptive Card to a Teams channel. <strong>The magic is that I didn’t have to build an Adaptive Card at all, and the entire thing took literally 5 minutes to create!</strong></p><p><strong><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Image-adaptive-card.png" alt="Screenshot of a Power Automate flow using the custom Adaptive Card connector"></strong></p><p>In the real world, Flows are typically kicked off by a “trigger.” Triggers can range from receiving an email, a message in a Teams channel, an issue filed in GitHub, to just about anything you can imagine. And of course, Power Automate is extensible so third parties can contribute Triggers and Actions to make your Flows even more powerful.</p><h3 id="The-Adaptive-Card-Custom-Connector"><a href="#The-Adaptive-Card-Custom-Connector" class="headerlink" title="The Adaptive Card Custom Connector"></a>The Adaptive Card Custom Connector</h3><p>Did you notice the box above that says, “Populate an Adaptive Card with a template and data”? That is a Custom Connector that I hope to make available shortly. It offers the same functionality as the template service, which means you can start using Adaptive Cards without having to write one yourself –<wbr> or even having to write any code!</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Adaptive-cards-2-917x1024.png" alt="Screenshot of a new preview of an Adaptive Card Power Automate Connector"></p><p>We’re very excited about the possibilities here to make Adaptive Cards available to more people and with less effort. Stay tuned as we figure out the next steps to make this connector publicly available.</p><h3 id="Lots-of-Designer-improvements-coming-soon"><a href="#Lots-of-Designer-improvements-coming-soon" class="headerlink" title="Lots of Designer improvements coming soon"></a>Lots of Designer improvements coming soon</h3><p>We also demoed some major improvements coming soon to the Designer. You can even <a href="https://adaptivecardsci.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr/3508/designer/?preview=1">try it out</a> right now!</p><h3 id="Improved-Data-Binding-UI"><a href="#Improved-Data-Binding-UI" class="headerlink" title="Improved Data Binding UI"></a>Improved Data Binding UI</h3><p>As templating gains traction, we want to ensure a smooth designer experience when building templates.</p><p>In the upcoming release you’ll be able to select any element and quickly bind it to data using the <strong>Bind…</strong> flyout. This same dialog is available in the <strong>Element Properties</strong> pane as well.</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Adaptive-cards-3.png" alt="Screenshot of the designer with a new data binding flyout "></p><h3 id="Schema-Version-Selection"><a href="#Schema-Version-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Schema Version Selection"></a>Schema Version Selection</h3><p>We’re also addressing a long-standing pain point: making sure the Designer builds cards that are as close as possible to the Host app you’re using. While we are working diligently with our partners to update to the latest Adaptive Cards version, we know schedules can be tricky and sometimes unforeseen compatibility bugs can delay the update.</p><p>To help alleviate this we’ve added a new <strong>Target version</strong> drop-down in in the designer toolbar. This drop-down helps ensure you won’t get any nasty surprises after you design a card and then try using it in a real app, like Teams or Outlook, which may not yet be on the latest version.</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Adaptive-cards-4.png" alt="Screenshot of the designer with Schema Version Selector drop down"></p><p>To use it, simply select the Schema Version that you’re targeting, and the Designer will remove elements and properties that are not available, as well as show warnings for any incompatible fields in the JSON.</p><p><a href="https://adaptivecardsci.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr/3508/designer/?preview=1"><strong>Try it out</strong></a>, and please <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/new?title=%5BDesigner%5D%20%5BYour%20feedback%20title%20here%5D&amp;body=%5BYour%20detailed%20feedback%20here%5D">let us know</a> if you hit any snags or have suggestions!</p><h3 id="Happy-Holidays-and-thank-you-for-a-fantastic-2019"><a href="#Happy-Holidays-and-thank-you-for-a-fantastic-2019" class="headerlink" title="Happy Holidays and thank you for a fantastic 2019!"></a><strong>Happy Holidays and thank you for a fantastic 2019!</strong></h3><p>I can’t believe this marks 12 months of the Adaptive Cards community call. I was nervous making this monthly commitment at the start of the year, mainly because I wasn’t sure we could come up with relevant content for you folks every month. Thankfully the feedback has been positive, and we will be continuing the series in 2020!

These SDKs allow you to populate a template with real data, on the back-end or directly on the client.</li><li>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/service">Template Service</a> is a proof-of-concept service that allows anyone to find, contribute to, and share a set of well-known templates.</li></ol><h2 id="Real-world-template-samples"><a href="#Real-world-template-samples" class="headerlink" title="Real-world template samples"></a>Real-world template samples</h2><p>Today we’re making it easier to get started by providing a handful of real-world templates on the <a href="https://adaptivecards.io/samples">Adaptive Cards Samples</a> page.</p><p>When the “Use Adaptive Card Templating” toggle switch is on, instead of seeing a single <code>JSON</code> textbox, you’ll see two:</p><ul><li><code>Data JSON</code> represents the card’s data</li><li><code>Template JSON</code> represents the card template</li></ul><p><a href="https://adaptivecards.io/samples"><img src="/blog/2019/Templating-on-Website/toggle-switch.png" alt="Try the new templated samples"></a></p><p>A “template” is an Adaptive Card that you’re used to, but all of the dynamically populated content has been replaced with “data-binding expressions”. For example, below is a card with a large, wrapping TextBlock, but the <code>text</code> property has those funny curly braces in it. That means this property will be provided dynamically from my app code.</p><p><strong>Card Template</strong></p><pre><code class="json">{    "type": "AdaptiveCard",    "version": "1.0",    "body": [        {             "type": "TextBlock",            "text": "{name}",            "size": "large",            "wrap": true        }    ]}</code></pre><h2 id="Using-a-template-in-your-app"><a href="#Using-a-template-in-your-app" class="headerlink" title="Using a template in your app"></a>Using a template in your app</h2><p>How exactly is that <code>text</code> property dynamically populated? By using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/sdk">Templating SDKs</a>. With the Templating SDKs, you can generate a fully-populated Adaptive Card, ready to send to any current host app!</p><p>This means you <strong>don’t have to wait for hosts to update to the latest version</strong> – you can get started today building cards for Teams, Outlook, and your own apps!**</p><p><em>Note:</em> during the preview, we only have .NET and JavaScript templating SDKs available.</p><p>Here’s some code using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/adaptivecards-templating"><code>adaptivecards-templating</code></a> JavaScript SDK to populate the template with data. In the real world, this data could be retrieved from a database, or service, or anywhere else you app code has access to.</p><pre><code class="js">var template = new ACData.Template({     // The Template above goes here});var dataContext = new ACData.EvaluationContext();// Put your data heredataContext.$root = {    "name": "Matt Hidinger"};var card = template.expand(dataContext);// Now you have an AdaptiveCard ready to render!</code></pre><h2 id="Get-started-today"><a href="#Get-started-today" class="headerlink" title="Get started today"></a>Get started today</h2><p>Adaptive Card templating can save a ton of time when building cards, and we hope these <a href="https://adaptivecards.io/samples">Samples</a> make it easier to get started!</p><p>Give it a shot and let us know your thoughts on <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues">GitHub</a>!</p><p>For more on this topic, check out <a href="https://medium.com/@tim.cadenbach/why-templating-for-adaptive-cards-is-a-game-changer-1606de3226ed">Why templating for Adaptive Cards is a Game Changer</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/TimCadenbach">Tim Cadenbach</a>.</p></body></html>]]></content>

The website is open-source and built by utilizing other files in the GitHub repository, like the JSON Schema, Samples payloads, etc. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/pull/3261">PR #3261</a> for all the code changes.</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-of-https-adaptivecards-io-1024x944.png" alt="screenshot of AdaptiveCards.io"></p><h3 id="New-ways-to-take-advantage-of-Adaptive-Cards-Templating"><a href="#New-ways-to-take-advantage-of-Adaptive-Cards-Templating" class="headerlink" title="New ways to take advantage of Adaptive Cards Templating"></a>New ways to take advantage of Adaptive Cards Templating</h3><p>The bulk of this call was spent reviewing the time-saving benefits of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/">Adaptive Cards Templating</a>, and introduced two new tools that help build reusable card templates faster than ever.</p><p>The first tool is a preview of the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/AdaptiveCards.Templating">AdaptiveCards.Templating</a> .NET SDK now available on NuGet. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/sdk">templating SDKs</a> (also available for JavaScript) make it easy to populate an Adaptive Card template with real data at runtime.</p><p>The second way we’re helping developers get started with templating is by updating all the Adaptive Card Samples with reusable template payloads. This is a major improvement over the existing Samples, which don’t make it very straight forward to populate them with your own data. We are also updating the Card Designer with full templating support. Stay tuned in the coming weeks for these updates and more to roll out to <a href="https://adaptivecards.io/">https://adaptivecards.io</a></p><p>And as always for the curious, the website code for these updates can be found in <a href="https://adaptivecardsci.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr/3505">PR #3505</a></p><p>Watch the call here.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GY8__dqPMiU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Next month’s call will be held on <strong>Thursday, November 14, 2019 at 9:00am PST.</strong> We look forward to talking to you then!

We are excited to provide you with a monthly opportunity to learn about Adaptive Cards in general, how they could be a great tool in your applications and contribute to the evolution of the format and SDKs.

This month we released the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/adaptivecards-fabric">adaptivecards-fabric</a> package, which makes “lighting up” an Adaptive Cards with Fabric components seamless. </p><p>Below is a standard Adaptive Card payload, but many of the inputs are rendered using Fabric components. If you’re using Fabric and Adaptive Cards give it a shot and let us know your thoughts!</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/access/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Standard-Adaptive-Card-payload-using-Microsoft-UI-Fabric.jpg" alt="Fabric screenshot"></p><h2 id="Adaptive-Cards-Template-Service-Prototype"><a href="#Adaptive-Cards-Template-Service-Prototype" class="headerlink" title="Adaptive Cards Template Service Prototype"></a>Adaptive Cards Template Service Prototype</h2><p>We also walked through a very early preview of an “Adaptive Card Template Service”, with the goal of making it easy to visualize any type of data using Adaptive Cards templates. This service empowers anyone to author and share card templates with the world – all with the simplicity of a GitHub backing store.</p><p><em>Legal terms: this <em>alpha-level</em> service is provided “as-is” with all faults and is not supported. Any data collection from the service is subject to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704">Microsoft privacy statement</a></em></p><p>The service currently offers some basic functionality:</p><p>•    <strong>FIND</strong> a template for a type of data (if one exists)<br>•    <strong>GET</strong> a known template. The template can then be used for client-side data binding using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/adaptivecards-templating">adaptivecards-template</a> package. (See the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/adaptive-cards-community-call-june-13-2019/">June community call</a> for more on this library)<br>•    <strong>POPULATE</strong> a known template with data server-side that can then be delivered to any adaptive card host</p><p>We’d love feedback on this service as you have it, please reach out to us on GitHub or Twitter if you have any thoughts, use-cases, or feedback! </p><p>Currently we have no date on when this will be production-ready as we are eager to learn how customers might use the service before we determine what our MVP is.</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/access/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/preview-of-an-%E2%80%9CAdaptive-Card-Template-Service%E2%80%9D-768x708.png" alt="postman screenshot"></p><p>Watch the call here.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4EOZyKbKog" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Next month’s call will be held on <strong>Thursday, August 8th, 2019 at 9:00am PST</strong>.

We're working closely with our partners to roll-out v1.2 as soon as possible.

This library adds <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/issues/2448">templating support</a> to Adaptive Cards, allowing the separation of content from the card layout. This work is currently in active development, so your feedback is most welcome. For plenty of deep dives on templating, take a look at previous Community Calls, and please reach out with any issues or feature suggestions.</p><p>You can also experiment with templating adaptive cards using the “next designer” at <a href="https://vnext.adaptivecards.io/designer">https://vnext.adaptivecards.io/designer</a>.</p><p>To use the <strong>adaptivecards-templating</strong> library, simply take an adaptive card you created in the vnext designer, and add templating expressions for the values you want to replace with real data, then pass that data along to the library as seen below. It will create a fully-populated adaptive card – ready to render!</p><pre><code class="js">// Define a template payloadvar templatePayload = {    "type": "AdaptiveCard",    "version": "1.0",    "body": [        {            "type": "TextBlock",            "text": "Hello {name}!"        }    ]};// Create a Template instance from the template payloadvar template = new ACData.Template(templatePayload);// Create a data context, and set its $root property to the// data object to bind the template tovar context = new ACData.EvaluationContext();context.$root = {    "name": "Groot"};// "Expand" the template - this generates the final Adaptive Card,// ready to rendervar card = template.expand(context);// Render the cardvar adaptiveCard = new AdaptiveCards.AdaptiveCard();adaptiveCard.parse(card);document.getElementById('exampleDiv').appendChild(adaptiveCard.render());</code></pre><p>Watch the call here.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UfHDlfN3E10" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Next month’s call will be held on <strong>Thursday, July 20, 2019 at 9:00am PST</strong>.

When opened, I can see the live stats of <a href="https://adaptivecards.io/">https://adaptivecards.io</a>, including the last 3 deployments, and usage metrics.</p><p><img src="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-1-1-1024x706.png" alt="Adding a tab that shows the live Azure stats of my currently selected repo."></p><p>To achieve this, all I had to do was teach GitHub Desktop to render Adaptive Cards.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>Since the 1.0 release of Adaptive Cards in March this year, the team has been hard at work on our 1.1 release, planning our 1.2 release and investigating the future of portable card and data formats for our 2.0 release.  Full release <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/AdaptiveCards/wiki/1.1-Feature-List">here</a></p><p>At the Microsoft Ignite conference we announced the general availability of Adaptive Cards 1.1, unblocking some of the most requested community and partner feature such as a Media element, Action Icons and more layout flexibility. </p><p><img src="/blog/2018/Announcing-1.1/designer.png" alt="designer"></p><p>We’ve also been expanding our tooling to try and address feedback that designing a card with our current designer was complex – that’s why we’re also excited about the <a href="https://aka.ms/adaptivedesigner">new visual designer</a> we announced at Ignite as well.  Now anyone can create an Adaptive Card through a simple drag and drop interface, opening up the format to designers, developers, and everyone in between.  And now with Adaptive Cards available in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/adaptive-card">Outlook as Actionable Messages</a>, in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana/skills/adaptive-cards">Cortana Skills</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/cards/cards-reference#adaptive-card">Microsoft Teams</a> through the Azure Bot Service, you can find even more ways to unlock your content with Adaptive Cards!</p></body></html>]]></content>
